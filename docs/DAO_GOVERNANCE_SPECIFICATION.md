# ROKO DAO Governance Specification

## Executive Summary

Based on the Exa Group's governance review (September 2024), this document outlines the comprehensive governance architecture for ROKO DAO, transitioning from a single-token monocameral system to a sophisticated multi-token, multicameral governance framework designed to prevent plutocratic influence and enhance community participation.

**Implementation**:
```solidity
interface IPowerROKO {
    function stake(uint256 amount) external;
    function unstake(uint256 amount) external;
    function delegate(address delegatee) external;
    function getVotingPower(address account) external view returns (uint256);

- Diamond Badge: 2x

#### Donor Recognition Tokens - ERC1155
**Purpose**: Acknowledge financial contributions
**Tiers**:
1. **Supporter** ($100-999):
   - Website recognition
   - Exclusive Discord channel
2. **Patron** ($1,000-9,999):

### 4.3 Voting Strategies

#### Weighted Voting
```
VotingPower = BaseTokens × ReputationMultiplier × TimeMultiplier
```

```
Cost = (NumberOfVotes)²
Impact = √(TokensSpent)
```

#### Time-Weighted Voting
```
Weight = Tokens × (1 + 0.1 × MonthsHeld)
```
